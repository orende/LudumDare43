The origins of the war lay in a breakthrough discovery, a scientific quantum leap: the invention of a device allowing the communication with another dimension.

But perhaps the most surprising thing was the responses from the other dimension. A lively interchange took place, and through the cooperation of the two civilizations the trans-dimensional technology was refined and developed. At first, larger amounts of data were sent and received, then energy in various forms and quantities, followed by inanimate matter.

Then one day, the first life forms made the trip from the other dimension to ours. The changes this brought upon the human civilization where as profound as they were far-reaching.

However, humans are an ever-changing species...

Soldier 1: The enemy has almost breached the outer hull! They’ve launched dropships with marines preparing to board us! What are your orders?

A:
[[Forget the fuel restrictions, there is no need to save fuel if we die here.|Forget the fuel restrictions]]
[[Well, what are you standing around for? Get your gun and let’s go!|Get yer gun]]
[[Close the bulkheads and detach command and control section of the ship.|Detach command section P1]]
[[Open a comm-channel to the other ships in the squadron. Order them to open fire... on our bridge.|Open fire on the bridge P1]]
[[We’ll lose them in the nebula.|Lose them in the nebula P1]]
[[I… I don’t know.|Do not know]]

The ship speeds up and your are thrown to the floor by the sudden acceleration. You crawl to one of the many emergency acceleration harnesses and wait. After what seems like an eternity the ship slows down, the immense pull of near light speed weakens its grip on your body. Outside the armored windows you spot an ominous sight... the (color: red)[Blood] Mist Nebula. You have arrived just at the outskirts of it.

Soldier 1: There’s an incoming transmission from the bridge... (he listens for a while) Sir, the CnC reports that the enemy dropships were dislodged by the sudden acceleration. We’re safe... well, for now at least.

A: What do you mean “for now”?

Soldier 1: According to the sitrep, we suffered severe damage to several ship systems in the attack. We’ve lost all function the hyperdrive steering systems. We’re currently drifting towards the Nebula.
A: Why are we drifting towards the Nebula? 

Soldier 1: We’re still unsure about the exact reasons. The Ship AI is currently analyzing the situation. The complete extent of the damage is still unknown, but it’s highly likely that they were compounded by the sudden hyperdrive activation.

A: Alright, keep me posted on further updates as soon as they are available. I will do a survey of the damage.

He readies his weapon and the two of you storm off to the elevators. You reach the section of the hull that’s being breached and await the first breakthrough of the boarders. Your commands to rally the other marines aboard the ship are effective and you lead a successful of defense of this section of the ship.

However...

A series of small explosions rock the ship as the bulkheads are detached. Communication from the bridge reaches a panicked crescendo and abruptly goes silent. The silence is broken by the ship AI.

Ship AI: Warning, detecting loss of the command and control section. Emergency maneuvers will be undertaken to return the ship to the main fleet for evacuation and recovery. Plotting a direct course to the ship...

He holds out the comm-device to you. You take it from him and start speaking:
